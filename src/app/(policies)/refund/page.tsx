      <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Subscription Billing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
        JJJ AI Pro and other paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring
        basis (monthly, yearly or as otherwise specified on the pricing page).
        Your subscription will automatically renew until cancelled.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Refunds</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fees already paid for an active billing period are generally
        non-refundable. However, if you experience a critical technical issue
        that prevents you from using the Service as advertised, you may contact
        us within 3 days of purchase and we will review your request on a
        case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Cancellations</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings
        or by contacting support. After cancellation, you will continue to have
        access to Pro features until the end of the current billing period. No
        further automatic charges will be made after that period.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        4. Trial &amp; Promotional Offers
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If we offer free trials or promotional pricing, the specific terms for
        those offers will be mentioned on the website. After the trial ends,
        regular plan charges will apply unless you cancel before the renewal
        date.
